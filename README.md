# Babel configuration examples

Configuring Babel can be hard, especially when you want to compile a package from another package, a specific dependency or all of them, or when you have shared files accross different packages.

This repository contains different examples to cover all those usecase: if you don't think that we are showing your current setup, please open an issue!

Before checking the examples, it is strongly reccomended to read our documentation: [Config Files](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/config-files).
